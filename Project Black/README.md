Project Black
========

Project Black is a web application made to assist people who are physically challenged by sight. It was originally made for a competition Oracle Thinkquest.

The project isn't complete yet. At first I used google's TTS but since it has limited access it got blocked after a few continuous requests. So I used multiple free webservers as proxies (which do not work anymore) for google's TTS as a temporary fix. I still am trying to find a TTS engine suitable for the project.

I also have plans for developing an Android app. Currently I am working on a chrome app for Project Black because the Chrome TTS is best suited for this project.
